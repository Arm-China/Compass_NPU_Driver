This case is for demostrating NPU DMA-BUF scheme, it consists of
DMA-BUF exporter and importer simulation.

- The simlation flow is as follows:
1. producer requests a dma-buf and fill it with inferrence input data;
2. inferrence server side wait and receive dma-buf's fd generated by
   producer. the server will specify this dma-buf as initial interrence
   input tensor buffer. it also will request a dma-buf as interrence output
   tensor buffer. finally, the server invokes inferrence and transfer fd of
   output tensor buffer(dma-buf) to consumer.
3. consumer wait and receive dma-buf's fd(output tensor buffer). then it
   compare the inferrence output with ground truth data.

- Files:
producer.cpp: as producer
dmabuf_producer_consumer.cpp: inferrence server
consumer.cpp: as consumter

- Simulation steps:
1. aipu_dmabuf_producer_consumer_test -b aipu.bin -i input.bin -o output.bin -o ./output

   here keep -i and -o options, just to make the case initialize normally. it has no need to
   include them in real scenario.

2. aipu_dmabuf_consumer output.bin
3. aipu_dmabuf_producer input.bin

  if output result is right or not, promt the below information from aipu_dmabuf_producer
